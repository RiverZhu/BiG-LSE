This code is written by Xupeng Lei and Jiang Zhu. The folder contains the programs for four BiG-LSE algorithm frameworks along with an example that allows you to observe the comparison between the proposed algorithm and other algorithms. Our algorithms programs are placed in the folder named "BiG-LSE" and include the following functions:  
1. **BiGLSE_prl**: Parallel initialization of BiG-LSE (para.), along with the function **BiGLSE_prl_lq** for handling low-precision quantization.  
2. **BiGLSE_seq**: Serial initialization of BiG-LSE (seri.), along with the function **BiGLSE_seq_lq** for handling low-precision quantization.  
3. **BiGLSE_vm**: Parallel initialization of BiG-LSE (para.), capable of directly processing low-precision quantized observations.  
4. **BiGLSE_prl**: Parallel initialization of BiG-LSE (para.), capable of directly processing low-precision quantized observations.  
Additionally, the folder contains Superfast LSE and NOMP for comparison, as well as GNOMP  for initialization in the quantization scenario. You can run the file named **demo_sim** to observe a comparison between the proposed algorithm and other algorithms such as NOMP and Superfast LSE, as well as a comparison of the performance across the four proposed algorithm frameworks. For details about the algorithm, please refer to our paper titled *"Expectation Propagation based Line Spectral Estimation"*.
